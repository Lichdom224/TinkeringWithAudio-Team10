#### ColeGGilbert - Cole Gilbert - Contract 3 Melody Generation (Non-Diegetic Audio)
The task is to create a tool which will procedurally generate and export a music track for a game. The tool will use tones and samples to create a music track that sounds good when put together, however will not be overly complex. The outputs of the contract will be simplistic and will use a large amount of random choice for music generation.
